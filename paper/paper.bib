The fundamental problem of accurate constraints on the cosmological parameters, within a given cosmological model, requires precise modelling of the observed structure. In this paper we briefly review the current most effective techniques of large scale structure simulations, emphasising both their advantages and shortcomings. Starting with basics of the direct N-body simulations appropriate to modelling cold dark matter evolution, we then discuss the direct-sum technique GRAPE, particle-mesh (PM) and hybrid methods, combining the PM and the tree algorithms. Simulations of baryonic matter in the Universe often use hydrodynamic codes based on both particle methods that discretise mass, and grid-based methods. We briefly describe Eulerian grid methods, and also some variants of Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) methods.},

We find that these MillimeterDL simulations can reproduce a wide range of non-Gaussian summary statistics matching the input training simulations, while only being optimized to match the power spectra. The procedure we develop in this work enables the capability to mass produce independent full-sky realizations from a single expensive full-sky simulation, when ordinarily the latter would not provide enough training data. We also circumvent a common limitation of high-resolution DL simulations that they be confined to small sky areas, often due to memory or GPU issues; we do this by developing a ``stitching'' procedure that can recover the large-scale, high-order statistics and avoid discontinuities or repeated features in the maps. In addition, since our network takes as input a full-sky lensing convergence map, it can in principle take a full-sky lensing convergence map from any large-scale structure (LSS) simulation and generate the corresponding lensed CMB and correlated foreground components at millimeter wavelengths; this is especially useful in the current era of combining results from both CMB and LSS surveys, which require a common set of simulations.}

Object fluxes are generated using a hybrid approach that combines (1) existing astrophysical halo models of radio galaxies from the literature to determine the positions and rank-ordering of the observed fluxes with (2) empirical models from the literature based on fits to the observed distribution of flux densities and (3) spectral indices drawn from an empirically-calibrated frequency-dependent distribution. The resulting population of radio galaxies is in excellent agreement with the number counts, polarization fractions, and distribution of spectral slopes from the data from observations at millimeter wavelengths from 20-200 GHz, including Planck, ALMA, SPT, and ACT. Since the radio galaxies are correlated with the existing cosmic infrared background (CIB), Compton-y (tSZ), and CMB lensing maps from Websky, our model makes new predictions for the cross-correlation power spectra and stacked profiles of radio galaxies and these other components. These simulations will be important for unbiased analysis of a wide variety of observables that are correlated with large-scale structure, such as gravitational lensing and SZ clusters.},

The algorithm uses a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) in the form of a convolutional neural network and is trained with SZ maps generated from the IllustrisTNG simulation. Our method can reproduce many of the details of galaxy clusters that analytical models usually lack, such as internal structure and aspherical distribution of gas created by mergers, while achieving the same computational feasibility, allowing us to generate mock SZ maps for over \$10\^{}5\$ clusters in 30 seconds on a laptop. We show that the model is capable of generating novel clusters (i.e. not found in the training set) and that the model accurately reproduces the effects of mass and mass accretion rate on the SZ images, such as scatter, asymmetry, and concentration, in addition to modeling merging sub-clusters. This work demonstrates the viability of machine-learning--based methods for producing the number of realistic, high-resolution maps of galaxy clusters necessary to achieve statistical constraints from future SZ surveys.},

Such simulated observations are a key technical challenge in cosmology because of the dynamic range and accuracy required. The first part of the pipeline generates a random cosmological realization in the form of a dark matter halo catalog and matter displacement field, as seen from a given position. The halo catalog and displacement field are modeled with ellipsoidal collapse dynamics and Lagrangian perturbation theory, respectively. In the second part, the cosmological realization is converted into a set of intensity maps over the range 10--103 GHz using models based on existing observations and hydrodynamical simulations. These maps include infrared emission from dusty star forming galaxies (CIB), Comptonization of CMB photons by hot gas in groups and clusters through the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZ), Doppler boosting by Thomson scattering of the CMB by bulk flows through the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ), and weak gravitational lensing of primary CMB anisotropies by the large-scale distribution of matter in the universe. After describing the pipeline and its implementation, we present the Websky maps, created from a realization of the cosmic web on our past light cone in the redshift interval 0},

  abstract = {We create realistic, full-sky, half-arcminute resolution simulations of the microwave sky matched to the most recent astrophysical observations. The primary purpose of these simulations is to test the data reduction pipeline for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) experiment; however, we have widened the frequency coverage beyond the ACT bands to make these simulations applicable to other microwave background experiments. Some of the novel features of these simulations are that the radio and infrared galaxy populations are correlated with the galaxy cluster populations, the CMB is lensed by the dark matter structure in the simulation via a ray-tracing code, the contribution to the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signals from galaxy clusters, groups, and the IGM has been included, and the gas prescription to model the SZ signals matches the most recent X-ray observations. Regarding the contamination of cluster SZ flux by radio galaxies, we find for 148 GHz (90 GHz) only 3\% (4\%) of halos have their SZ decrements contaminated at a level of 20\% or more. We find the contamination levels higher for infrared galaxies. However, at 90 GHz, less than 20\% of clusters with M\_\{200\} {$>$} 2.5 x 10\^{}\{14\} Msun and z{$<$}1.2 have their SZ decrements filled in at a level of 20\% or more. At 148 GHz, less than 20\% of clusters with M\_\{200\} {$>$} 2.5 x 10\^{}\{14\} Msun and z{$<$}0.8 have their SZ decrements filled in at a level of 50\% or larger. Our models also suggest that a population of very high flux infrared galaxies, which are likely lensed sources, contribute most to the SZ contamination of very massive clusters at 90 and 148 GHz. These simulations are publicly available and should serve as a useful tool for microwave surveys to cross-check SZ cluster detection, power spectrum, and cross-correlation analyses.},

  abstract = {The pseudo-\$C\_{\textbackslash}ell\$ is an algorithm for estimating the angular power and cross-power spectra that is very fast and, in realistic cases, also nearly optimal. The algorithm can be extended to deal with contaminant deprojection and \$E/B\$ purification, and can therefore be applied in a wide variety of scenarios of interest for current and future cosmological observations. This paper presents NaMaster, a public, validated, accurate and easy-to-use software package that, for the first time, provides a unified framework to compute angular cross-power spectra of any pair of spin-0 or spin-2 fields, contaminated by an arbitrary number of linear systematics and requiring \$B\$- or \$E\$-mode purification, both on the sphere or in the flat-sky approximation. We describe the mathematical background of the estimator, including all the features above, and its software implementation in NaMaster. We construct a validation suite that aims to resemble the types of observations that next-generation large-scale structure and ground-based CMB experiments will face, and use it to show that the code is able to recover the input power spectra in the most complex scenarios with no detectable bias. NaMaster can be found at https://github.com/LSSTDESC/NaMaster, and is provided with comprehensive documentation and a number of code examples.},

  abstract = {Boltzmann codes are used extensively by several groups for constraining cosmological parameters with Cosmic Microwave Background and Large Scale Structure data. This activity is computationally expensive, since a typical project requires from 10'000 to 100'000 Boltzmann code executions. The newly released code CLASS (Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System) incorporates improved approximation schemes leading to a simultaneous gain in speed and precision. We describe here the three approximations used by CLASS for basic LambdaCDM models, namely: a baryon-photon tight-coupling approximation which can be set to first order, second order or to a compromise between the two; an ultra-relativistic fluid approximation which had not been implemented in public distributions before; and finally a radiation streaming approximation taking reionisation into account.},
