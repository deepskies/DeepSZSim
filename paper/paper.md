# Summary

< 10 sentences

Broad context of the field. State of the art simulations for SZ effect. Need for and current lack of fast, accessible simulations for ML. Dual purpose of student training. Tunability of sims and near-term goals for ML use with Deep Skies.

# Statement of need

< 20 sentences

Field need for well-tuned sims and ML methods. Niche our sims fill with Deep Skies, student training, and future science plans.

# Features

Descriptions of functions included in DeepSZSim. Figure 1: code schematic. Figure 2: Submaps, 4x4, including 1D pressure profile, 2D Compton-y map, 2D all-noise map, and 2D all+noise map.
